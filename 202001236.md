**Q1**

The institute has been recently set up to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the
field of Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also
includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by
the institution.

As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to
develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the
institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting
at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing
if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system
aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has
administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into
the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is
taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search booksonline. 
However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.


Answer:

**1) Functional Requirements**:

                            1> Issuing or Returning books is only valid for LIC users.
                            2> The system recognize the user before give them the access of borrow a book.
                            3> Any Non member is free to use the system to browse or search the books online.
                            4> Web Application should only run within institute LAN.
                            5> The librarian(administrative) has the control on deleting or enter a new record.
                            6> A databsae log for all books (include issued and not issued)
                            7> There should be a backup for the database so that in case of problem, data of the users and books remain safe.
                            8> The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing if no other booking for that particular book has been made.


**2) Nonfunctionl Requirements**: 

                              1>Usability: The website should be easy to handle ans use. It should be easy to navigate.
                              2>Performance: If there are multiple users access the website then website should not be crashed.
                              3>Security: The system should be able to protect the information about users and books.
                              4>Maintenance: The system should be easy to maintain and update.
                              5>Scalability: The system has to be scalable so when the number of users increase then the system should be able to handle the situation.
                              6>concurrency: the system is able to handle many users at a time.


**Q2**

Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from
disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that
addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to
recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies,
where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized
for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.

Answer:

**1) Scope**:

         1> We have to create a mobile application that helps every people which are suffer from hearing loss(disable).
         2> Our mobile application will use artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events of interest, such as car horns and babies.
         3> The apllication will be optimized for IOS and Android devices and will work with low-latency.

**2) Features**:

            1> Immediate alerts when key sound events are detected.
            2> Optimized for devices with low-latency for real-time use.
            3> Continual loging of sound events for the user.
            4> Less power used by the application.
            
**3) Non-Functional aspects**:

                          1> Usability: The app should be easy to use and navigate for users with disabling hearing loss.
                          2>Reliability: The Application should be reliable and produce accurate results.
                          3>Power Consumption: The app should minimize the power consumption to for long battery life.
                          4>Maintainability: The app should be easily updated and maintained.
                          5> Performance: The app should have a fast response time and high throughput to ensure that sound events are recognized.
                          6>Security: The application should protect the sensitive users information.
                          7>Scalability: The app should be able to handle a large number of users and sound events.
